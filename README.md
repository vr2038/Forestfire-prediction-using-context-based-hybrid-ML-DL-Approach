# Forestfire-prediction-using-context-based-hybrid-ML-DL-Approach

A Hybird Approach Using Context based fire risk, LSTM, and XGBoost. A hybrid wildfire prediction system using CBFR, LSTM, and XGBoost models with a Linear Regression meta-learner. It analyzes historical and real-time data to predict forest fire risks accurately, supporting early warnings and proactive disaster management.

DATA: Extracted data from IBM RESEARCH DEVELOPER - https://developer.ibm.com/data/

CBFR (Context-Based Fire Risk Model): Analyzes historical weather and wildfire data, detects anomalies using clustering techniques, and generates dynamic fire risk scores.

LSTM Model: Captures long-term temporal dependencies to identify wildfire trends over time.

XGBoost Model: Learns complex and non-linear patterns in fire behavior based on environmental features.

Ensemble Meta-Learner: Combines predictions from LSTM and XGBoost using Linear Regression for higher accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: Compared with Random Forest and few traditional models, achieving relatively better and improved prediction reliability with lower computational efficiency.
